\begin{abstract}
    This report discusses a performance focused implementation of the Kihi programming language, called the Kihi Runner. This includes an explanation on all the necessary background material, including an explanation of the language itself. This heart of this report is a description and evaluation of a two phase optimisation method that has been implemented in the Kihi Ruuner. The two phases consist of symbol detection and symbol optimisation. This process aims to dynamically construct a more efficient representation of a Kihi program. The question of whether this optimisation method is effective is the central question of the report.
