\chapter*{Acknowledgements} \label{C:ack} 
I'd like to acknowledge my supervisor, Michael Homer, for his support and advice. I'd also like to acknowledge my friends, my family, and the 4th year engineering cohort who have all been with me through thick and thin; I don't know if I would be here without you.
