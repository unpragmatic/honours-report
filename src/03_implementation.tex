\chapter{Implementation} \label{C:implementation} 

This paper is about an implementation of Kihi virtual machine
in Rust. This language was chosen for its support for low
level programming but also because it provides guarantees about
memory safety and expressive high level abstractions.

\section{Language Choice}

\section{Optimisation}
There were two primary optimisations implemented in the Kihi virtual
machine. Firstly, symbolic analysis: finding commonly occuring or
meaningful sequences of terms, and secondly symbol optimisation: the
process of dynamicly constructing a more efficient method of executing
a symbol. 

\subsection{Symbolic Analysis}

The Kihi virtual machine implements a relatively simple symbol analyser.
The base symbolic analyser combines adjacent operators into symbols. The
motivation behind this method
