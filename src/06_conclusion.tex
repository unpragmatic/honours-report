\chapter{Conclusions}\label{C:con}
Overall, this project has been successful. The evaluation has shown that the two phase optimisation strategy introduced into the Kihi Runner is effective. Whilst the vast majority of the benefits are gained from the first symbol detection phase due to improvement memory characteristics. The latter phase is still beneficial and is worthy of further research. Furthermore, the project has established a solid foundation for any potential future work. The software architecture of the application lends itself to modification and readability through interfaces and modular design. And the extensive benchmark suite provides the groundwork for any future performance based projects. This report has also outline many potential ideas that could be readily implemented into this project or any others, in particular the potential for the two phase optimisation strategy to be utilised in other languages.
