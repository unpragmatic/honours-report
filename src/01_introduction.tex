\chapter{Introduction} \label{C:intro}
A principal concern of many programming languages is performance. The goal of this project is to address those concerns in the context of the Kihi programming language. Specifically, this project attempts to addresses those concerns by creating a performance focussed implementation of the language. This implementation, also referred to as the Kihi Runner, is distinguished by its performance focussed features, in particular an optimisation pipeline capable of dynamically constructing more efficient and compact representations of Kihi programs. How effective these optimisations are is the primary question this report attempts to answer.

Firstly however, the report begins with a treatment of surrounding background material in chapter \ref{C:background}. This most importantly includes a explanation of the Kihi language and its origins, with special attention paid to its raison d'Ãªtre and unique characteristics. However, this material may be skipped by readers who are already familiar with the language. The follow chapter presents the brunt of this project's work. It describes the design and implementation of the Kihi Runner, illustrating the various features of the Kihi Runner. Most interestingly, this includes an explanation of the aforementioned optimisation pipeline. 

The report closes with an evaluation of the Kihi Runner,
