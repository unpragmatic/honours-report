todo make numbers work in a flat hierachy  (i.e. do no preprocess)

Could design an interpreter that uses stack until a value is requested. When a
value is requested then left reduce could be used.

Combine the tree encoding technology with the stack execution technology.in

Arity analysis would played with but not tangible results were found.

Future work could also include adding a JIT compiler to the left reduce based version.z


Mixture of stack based execution and reduction.
Use seek to find a spot to stack execute from.

Add symbolic execution to the stack model.

Perfor multi pass optimisation of symbols.

Combine symbols that can be combined. i.e. s1 :: 2 arg -> 0 , s2 :: 0 arg -> 1 arg => s1 s2 :: 1 arg -> 0
